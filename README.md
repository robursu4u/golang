# golang

Web framework with Go language and Angularjs 2. Go to www.bobcast.space to see the end result.

Things to keep in mind

1. Go packages are a bit out of date. Updating next chance I get.
2. This is not complete. Lots of finishing and polishing required. Working on it everyday.
3. If you install locally, you may get a gopath error. Errors about not being able to find
packages. If you do, you'll have to modify your .bashrc file. I found this link to be helpful:

If you want to run locally: 

1. Download and extract the files. 
2. Go into src/github.com/robursu4u/main/main.go and change ":80" to ":3000"
3. Install Go (https://golang.org/doc/install)
4. $go run main.go 
5. Go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
